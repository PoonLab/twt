Parameters:

  beta:  1e-4  # transmission rate
  gamma:  0.1  # clearance rate
  psi:  0.05  # sampling rate
  omega:  0.01  # loss of immunity

Sampling:
  mode: compartment  # indicates that one or more Compartments represent a 
                     # sampled state (could also call this 'serial')
  targets:
    I_samp: 100  # if compartment reaches this target size then stop forward-
                 # time simulation early
