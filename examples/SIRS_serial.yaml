Parameters:
  originTime:  10.0  # simulation time units before most recent sample date
  lambda: 1e-3  # birth rate (susceptibles only)
  mu: 5e-4  # baseline death rate
  mu2: 0.01  # infected death rate
  beta:  1e-4  # transmission rate
  gamma:  0.1  # clearance rate
  psi:  0.05  # sampling rate
  omega:  0.01  # loss of immunity

Compartments:
  S:
    birth: lambda*S
    death: mu*S
    transmission:
      I: beta*S*I
    size: 9999  # initial
  I:
    migration:
      S: mu2*I  # death is instantly replaced
      R: gamma*I
      I_samp: psi*I
    size: 1  # index case!
    bottleneck.size: 1  # define only for compartments that carry Pathogens
    coalescent.rate: 0.01
  I_samp:
    size: 0
  R:
    migration:
      S: omega*R+mu*R  # revert to susceptible
    size: 0

Sampling:
  mode: compartment  # indicates that one or more Compartments represent a sampled state (could also call this 'serial')
  targets:
    I_samp: 100  # if compartment reaches this target size then stop forward-time simulation
